# YouTox
Sentiment Analysis/Webscraper

## Description 
Designed basic tkinter application to scrape google news (edited application of prior work), youtube comments with selenium, and recognized user inputted comments to demonstrate the filtering of basic logistic regression prediction models. 

## Results 
Three Pages (Home, About, YouTube) bring the viewer to three distinct parts of the tkinter application. User can input corpus for trained model to predict its toxicity and observe "today's news" as well as sentiment and toxicity of youtube comments. 

## Future Work

The current project can be built upon by adding features to embed youtube videos, store multiple models, or speed up runtime of tkinter GUI by developing into web application. 

## Acknowledgements 

I would like to thank Dunmin Zhu (dunminz@andrew.cmu.edu) for partnering with me and aiding with the graphics and coding logic along the way of constructing the project.
