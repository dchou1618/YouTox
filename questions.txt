Regressions and web-scraping to analyze sentiment and toxicity online


We created a Tkinter application that can allow users to analyze sentiment based on their input or from online webpages. We used selenium to web-scrape youtube comments and beautiful soup to scrape google news for daily news, which displays in a tkinter GUI. We implemented sentimental analyses based on training data of wikipedia comments, which is demonstrated in the diagrams.

Larded with many several sorts of reasons
Importing Denmark's health and England's too,
With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,
That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,
My head should be struck off.
